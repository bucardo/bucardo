TODO list for Bucardo
=====================

These range the gamut from wildly speculative ideas to must-have features.

- Have Bucardo do the cleanups based on PG version, rather than cronjobs
  (e.g. vacuum pg_listener, purge_bucardo_delta)
- Implement "log shipping" for pushdelta slaves. This could be done by creating 
  a SQL dump consisting of DELETE from <tab> WHERE pk IN (...); COPY <tab> 
  FROM STDIN; ...
- Death-level custom code hooks
- Better conflict example in test suite, uses database handles
- Make timeslices for master_q adjustable
- Allow more data types for pkey on goats
- Handle partitioned tables
- Allow notification emails to be regex sorted, e.g. serialization warnings
- Make bucardo_ctl use same algorithm as bucardo-report for grabbing sync history
- Address all XXX and TODO inside Bucardo.pm
- Have a single table track current status of each sync/target combo. This would 
  allow the controller to do smarter things, and would make the reporting much faster
- Add a pause mode
- Add exception code for DELETE
- Purge or move audit_pid on startup
- I8n all messages/docs/etc.
- Allow targets to be hard-linked: nobody goes on until everyone has finished
- Support large objects
- Support system tables (Postgres 12.0?)
- Check for superuser on startup, to prevent errors that only show when a KID tries something.
- Add a flag that allows for table structure checking before each sync
- Make a Bucardo bundle for CPAN-like fun
- Readonly slaves: trigger/rule to prevent with good message
- bucardo_help() function to explain all
- Handle non-orderable data types such as polygons
- Put this list into a bug tracker
- Use 2PC where possible
- Consider intra-kid communication to copy tables one-by-one to keep things in cache
- Consider failover strategies
- Log validate_sync changes somewhere, add rollback statements
- Consider keeping long-term stats for a sync/table: total rows transferred, etc.
- Add support for manual DDL changes (in progress)
- Add support for automatic DDL changes (in progress)
- Cascading slaves: makedelta should create infrastructure as necessary
- Use polling not sleep for loop notificationa

- Remove large src_code sections from the kid output when dieing
- Force to C locale until we get i18n in place

- Clean out dbrun when starting up

- Use C triggers for the delta stuff if we can

Test: no Dumper without a $DEBUG in bucardo_ctl
