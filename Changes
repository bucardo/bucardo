[GSM is Greg Sabino Mullane <greg@endpoint.com> <greg@turnstep.com> ]

Bucardo version 4.3.0

  - Add new column to customcode: trigrules. Defaults to false: if true, 
    we turn on triggers and rules for the duration of the custom code. [GSM]

  - Add a new configuration value 'host_safety_check', to help prevent 
    Bucardo from being copied from one host to another and then run 
    without modifying at least bucardo.db.dbhost first. [GSM]

  - For custom code exception handlers, make the 'dbi_error' hash key return 
    a flattened string of the actual exception thrown. [GSM]

  - Better upgrading of very old versions of Bucardo. [GSM]

  - Allow add, remove, and list customcode through bucardo_ctl [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.2.2, released October 2, 2009

  - Fix so that warning_file works properly again. [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.2.1, released October 1, 2009

  - Improve ability of 'bucardo_ctl upgrade' to work against older
    versions of Bucardo [GSM]

  - Changed the chunking threshold for pushdelta to 100,000 and 10,000 [GSM]

  - Make bucardo_ctl list table|sequence follow same wildcard rules as 
    other list nouns. [GSM]

  - Remove the old 'alter' verb from bucardo_ctl: use 'update' instead [GSM]

  - Fix a SQL error in 'bucardo_ctl status <sync> [GSM]

  - Remove the unused t/bucardo.test.data file [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.2.0, released September 30, 2009

  - Add the "delta_bypass" feature, which allows a pushdelta sync to switch 
    to 'fullcopy' mode on the fly, depending on the number of rows that 
    have changed. [GSM]

  - Fixed an error preventing customselect from working in certain situations. [GSM]

  - Have 'bucardo_ctl install' check for successful plperlu installation. [GSM]

  - Clean up and standardize all the bucardo_ctl list/add/remove actions. [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.1.2, released September 25, 2009

 - Fix sequence replication by setting is_called properly on the targets
   [GSM, thanks to Selena Deckelmann for discovering this]

 - Respect server_side_prepares db setting in validate_sync. Previously, 
   this function would fail if validating more than one table at a time 
   and the database was set as server_side_prepares off [GSM]

 - Make sure we cast rowid* to text within the bucardo_add_delta-called 
   functions, for picky versions of Postgres. [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.1.1, released September 24, 2009

 - Fix case where Bucardo was too eager to lock tables post serialization 
   failures. Since we can't really do this automatically and safely, 
   remove the code in question for now. [GSM, hat tip to Selena Deckelmann]

Bucardo version 4.1.0, released September 24, 2009

  - Fix problem with possible function name collision when the names 
    of the combined columns in the primary key is greater than NAMEDATALEN, 
    which we'll assume is 63. [GSM]

  - Add "bucardo_ctl inspect table" to show all dependencies, as well 
    as cross referencing against herds the table is in [GSM]

  - Fix an error when validate_sync tries to recreate an existing trigger; 
    occurred when a fullcopy sync was set to ping=true [GSM]

  - When using "bucardo_ctl add all tables db=<name>", make sure we only 
    look for the already added tables for that specific database.
    [Selena Deckelmann and Josh Tolley]

  - Add new boolean column to the "db" table named "server_side_prepares", which 
    is true by default. If off, Bucardo will not use server-side prepared 
    statements, and thus can be used in PgBouncer's transaction mode.
    [GSM, idea by Andrew Spencer]

  - During pushdelta, break large number of rows for a single table until multiple 
    DELETE and COPY calls, to help debugging, to allow for a progress indicator 
    both at the Bucardo and Postgres levels, and to prevent crashes seen on 
    older versions of Postgres when very large IN() lists are used. [GSM]

  - When using "bucardo_ctl add all tables", ignore any tables inside 
    schemas starting with 'bucardo' [GSM]

  - Allow --verbose flag for list syncs to show linked tables [GSM]

  - Allow --verbose flag for list tables to show linked herds and syncs [GSM]

  - Change rebuild_index to a smallint: a 1 only runs it with a fullcopy.
    If you really want to use it otherwise, set it to 2 [GSM]

  - Allow the dbhost to be turned off (local socket only) in the db table 
    when using "bucardo_ctl update db <name> host=non. [GSM]


Bucardo version 4.0.3, released September 16, 2009

  - Fix some minor problems with bucardo_ctl and "add sync" [GSM]

  - Allow ping to be specified for new tables added via "add sync" [GSM]


Bucardo version 4.0.2, released September 16, 2009

  - Add the name of the database to the install choices, as some systems 
    have mismatched names (BSD's 'pgsql' user) [Vilem Kebrt]

  - Clear out stale q entries on startup, created when a kid was hit with a 
    kill -9. This was causing Bucardo to think the q slot was still active. [GSM]

  - Fix cases where we were not quoting the UNLISTEN names [GSM]

  - Remove duplicate PID numbers from log [GSM]

  - Prohibit syncs from having names reserved for synctypes. [GSM]

  - Add new delete method of "truncate_cascade" for syncs [GSM]

  - Allow "foo*", "*foo", and "*foo*" wildcard format in bucardo_ctl 
    when specifying syncs, e.g. bucardo_ctl kick ABC* [GSM]

  - Allow special cases for bucardo_ctl kick: "all [synctype] [active]" [GSM]

  - Allow filtering of 'bucardo_ctl list syncs' by synctype [GSM]

  - Allow 'bucardo_ctl add sync tables=...' to work with schema.table format [GSM]

  - Add --verbose option to 'bucardo_ctl list syncs' to show tables [GSM]

    "bucardo_ctl add sync source=dbname ... tables=x,y,z" [GSM]

  - Allow multiple items to be changed at one time with 'bucardo_ctl update item' [GSM]

  - Change validate_sync notice to LOG [GSM]


Bucardo version 4.0.1, released September 8, 2009

  - Fix to allow "add all tables db=foo" to work as expected. [GSM]

  - Set audit_pid to be off by default. [GSM]

  - Fix broken WHERE clause inside bucardo_ctl for "add table" [GSM]


Version 4.0.0, released September 7, 2009

New features:

  - Add support for multi-column primary keys. Thanks to Backcountry.com. [GSM]

  - Add new 'onetimecopy' attribute to sync table, to allow recreation on 
    demand of pushdelta tables on slaves via COPY. [GSM]

  - Support for replication after TRUNCATE. This will only work on 
    Postgres version 8.4 and higher, and only pushdelta syncs. [GSM]

  - Add log_conflict_details to allow logging of conflict information 
    to a separate file. [Adam Wendt]

  - Add 'maxkicks' and 'lifetime' to syncs to force restart of controller 
    and kids after a certain number of kicks or time. [Josh Tolley]
    Thanks to Backcountry.com.

  - Allow replication of sequences. [GSM]

  - Add the bucardo_custom_trigger table, which allows tight control of exactly 
    what items in a table will be replicated. [Ben Allen]

  - Add the bucardo_rate table to track exactly how long replication takes
    on a per-sync and per-table basis. [GSM]

  - Add more bucardo_ctl actions: install, reload, validate, restart, update [GSM]

  - Allow adding of all tables and sequences in a database at once via bucardo_ctl [GSM]

  - Add in bucardo_compress_delta function, to remove duplicate rows from 
    the bucardo_delta table. [GSM]

  - Allow the injection of custom messages into the Bucardo logs, and make 
    an interface for same in bucardo_ctl. [GSM]

  - Add the "warning_file" config parameter to log all 'Warning' messages. [GSM]

  - Add validate_all_syncs() function, and allow an argument to both that 
    and validate_sync() to force recreation of supporting objects. [GSM]

Enhancements:

  - Remove 'Moose' dependency. [GSM]

  - Remove disable_triggers and disable_rules from the sync table. 
    We simply choose pg_class or replica based on the version of the 
    database in question. [GSM]

  - Rewrite the pushdelta sync method to be more efficient and safer. [GSM]

  - Change from Mail::Sendmail to Net::SMTP [Ben Allen]

  - Allow wildcards in the 'bucardo_ctl kick' [Josh Tolley]

  - Improve the FreeBSD scripts/bucardo_ctl.rc file [Ben Allen]

  - Add "sendmail" option to the customcode input. [Ben Allen]

  - Add 'bucardo_ctl upgrade' to make intra-version upgrades easy 
    and automatic. [Selena Deckelmann and GSM]

  - Add more tests and improve existing ones. [Josh Tolley]

  - Force READ WRITE mode so Bucardo works on read only databases. [GSM]

  - Make the audit_pid table more useful. Use sequences instead of 
    PIDs to find children. Allow for the audit_pid table to be toggled off. [GSM]

  - Remove the debugstderr and debugstdout options, as they never worked 
    correctly anyway. [GSM]

  - When truncating during fullcopy, fallback to delete if it fails. [GSM]

  - On startup, all syncs that may have trigger-based notifies are 
    initially kicked. [GSM]

  - MCP listens for pings during table validations. [GSM]

  - Have master_q use a trigger, not multiple rules. Remove the need 
    for a separate create_child_q() function. [GSM]

  - Default for log_showtime is now 'scalar localtime' rather than 
    epoch seconds. [GSM]

  - No longer require a reason for the "stop" action. [GSM]

  - Add INSTALL_BUCARDODIR for quick and dirty 'make install' [GSM]

Bug fixes:

  - Fix failure to disable/enable triggers when using pg_class and table 
    and schema are words changed by quote_ident. [Ben Allen]

  - Tolerate incompatibility in DEFAULT of negative numbers between 
    Postgres 8.2 and 8.3. [Jon Jensen]

  - Do better checking of bucardo_ctl executable when MCP is restarting. [Ben Allen]

  - Change timestamp to timestamptz where needed inside Bucardo.pm [Yan Farmawan]
