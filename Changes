Bucardo version 4.5.0, released ??, 2010

  - Redo the makedelta system, and break into source_makedelta and target_makedelta 
    options for both syncs and goats, which inherit from the higher level (goat

  - Overhaul of sequence handling: now allows for all attributes to be replicated, 
    such as INCREMENT_BY and MAXVALUE [GSM]

  - Allow triggers and rules to work on bucardo_delta and bucardo_track by 
    setting new column bucardo.db.makedelta_triggers to true. [GSM]

  - Fix errors with bytea and swap syncs. [GSM]

  - Force time zone to GMT to resolve timestamptz issues with bucardo_delta
    [GSM, Michelle Sullivan]

  - Add a log_level parameter, and classify all messages inside Bucardo.pm
    with a log_level of TERSE, NORMAL, VERBOSE, or DEBUG. [Rosser Schwarz and GSM]

  - Relax SELECT version() regex in bucardo_ctl, to let modified versions 
    of Postgres tell us their version. [GSM]

  - Fix incorrect automatic population of database when using bucardo_ctl 
    add database and only one database exists. [GSM]

  - Fix failing makedelta when using multi-column primary keys. 
    [GSM, reported by Michelle Sullivan]

  - Do not perform a checktime kick if onetimecopy mode is on. [GSM]

  - New syncs of type fullcopy now default to false for ping, stayalive, 
    and kidsalive. [GSM, idea from Andrew Spencer]

  - Refuse to start if the bucardo database version does not match that of 
    bucardo_ctl (the former is set by 'bucardo_ctl upgrade') [GSM]

  - Set the search_path to prevent bogus warnings on startup about sequence 
    mismatches based on schema names. [GSM] (Bug #17)

  - Add a --force option so we can remove databases via 'bucardo_ctl remove db'
    along with all related goats and syncs. [GSM]

  - Remove race condition from bucardo_purge_q_table() [GSM]

  - Add new options for 'bucardo_ctl add db': addalltables and addallsequences [GSM]

  - Don't bother comparing the 'log_cnt' field of sequences. [Rosser Schwarz]

  - Allow "schema.table" format for bucardo_ctl list tables [GSM]

  - Add new option "log_microsecond" to show sub-second output in logs. [GSM]

  - Make sure we update bucardo_config.bucardo_current_version when doing 
    a bucardo_ctl upgrade [GSM] (Bug #5)

  - Automatically create the bucardo (superuser) if we can connect as 'postgres'. [GSM]

  - Allow removal of tables from herds via bucardo_ctl. [GSM]

  - Add create_child_q_table() function. [GSM]

  - Allow 'bucardo_ctl update herd foo remove <table(s)>'
    and 'bucardo_ctl update herd foo add <table(s)>' [GSM]

  - Allow validate_goat() to work correctly against pgbouncer databases by 
    respecting the server_side_prepares parameter. [GSM]

  - Loosen restrictions on customcode - now the derived columns must match 
    the target, but the target and source tables can be completely different. [GSM]

  - Add the bucardo_audit() function that runs on all master databases, ensures 
    that everything related to the bucardo_* control tables is correct.
    [Josh Tolley and GSM]

  - Fix bucardo_ctl add sync ... tables=x - now adds the sync on first pass, 
    even if the tables have not been added. [GSM]

  - Adding customcode via bucardo_ctl can now specify sync, goat, priority, 
    and active columns. [GSM]

  - When viewing customcode via 'bucardo_ctl list code foo', the src_code column 
    is shown last. [GSM]

  - Add some small sleeps before checking for stale pid files, to allow their owners 
    a chance to clean them up first. [GSM]

    older versions of Postgres. [GSM]

  - Allow testing of multiple versions of Postgres at the same time by setting the 
    environment variables PGBINDIR[A-Z]. [GSM]

  - Don't look for hard-coded string to determine if cluster is up [GSM, thanks 
    to Andre Felipe Machado for suggesting]


Bucardo version 4.3.0, released October 8, 2009

  - Allow MCP and CTL to kill based on piddir, not just audit_pid. This will prevent duplicate 
    kids from existing if audit_pid is switched off. [GSM]

  - Fix error in lowest/highest conflict handling. [Mathieu Arnold]

  - Add new column to customcode: trigrules. Defaults to false: if true, 
    we turn on triggers and rules for the duration of the custom code. [GSM]

  - Add a new configuration value 'host_safety_check', to help prevent 
    Bucardo from being copied from one host to another and then run 
    without modifying at least bucardo.db.dbhost first. [GSM]

  - For custom code exception handlers, make the 'dbi_error' hash key return 
    a flattened string of the actual exception thrown. [GSM]

  - Ensure exiting processes always remove their pidfile. [GSM]

  - Allow bucardo_ctl upgrade to remove configuration settings. [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.2.2, released October 2, 2009

  - Fix so that warning_file works properly again. [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.2.1, released October 1, 2009

  - Improve ability of 'bucardo_ctl upgrade' to work against older
    versions of Bucardo [GSM]

  - Changed the chunking threshold for pushdelta to 100,000 and 10,000 [GSM]

  - Make bucardo_ctl list table|sequence follow same wildcard rules as 
    other list nouns. [GSM]

  - Remove the old 'alter' verb from bucardo_ctl: use 'update' instead [GSM]

  - Remove the unused t/bucardo.test.data file [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.2.0, released September 30, 2009

    to 'fullcopy' mode on the fly, depending on the number of rows that 
    have changed. [GSM]

  - Fixed an error preventing customselect from working in certain situations. [GSM]

  - Have 'bucardo_ctl install' check for successful plperlu installation. [GSM]

  - Clean up and standardize all the bucardo_ctl list/add/remove actions. [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.1.2, released September 25, 2009

 - Fix sequence replication by setting is_called properly on the targets
   [GSM, thanks to Selena Deckelmann for discovering this]

 - Respect server_side_prepares db setting in validate_sync. Previously, 
   this function would fail if validating more than one table at a time 
   and the database was set as server_side_prepares off [GSM]

 - Make sure we cast rowid* to text within the bucardo_add_delta-called 
   functions, for picky versions of Postgres. [GSM]

Bucardo version 4.1.1, released September 24, 2009

 - Fix case where Bucardo was too eager to lock tables post serialization 
   failures. Since we can't really do this automatically and safely, 
   remove the code in question for now. [GSM, hat tip to Selena Deckelmann]

Bucardo version 4.1.0, released September 24, 2009

  - Fix problem with possible function name collision when the names 
    of the combined columns in the primary key is greater than NAMEDATALEN, 
    which we'll assume is 63. [GSM]

  - Add "bucardo_ctl inspect table" to show all dependencies, as well 
    as cross referencing against herds the table is in [GSM]

  - Fix an error when validate_sync tries to recreate an existing trigger; 
    occurred when a fullcopy sync was set to ping=true [GSM]

  - When using "bucardo_ctl add all tables db=<name>", make sure we only 
    look for the already added tables for that specific database.
    [Selena Deckelmann and Josh Tolley]

  - Add new boolean column to the "db" table named "server_side_prepares", which 
    is true by default. If off, Bucardo will not use server-side prepared 
    statements, and thus can be used in PgBouncer's transaction mode.
    [GSM, idea by Andrew Spencer]

  - During pushdelta, break large number of rows for a single table until multiple 
    DELETE and COPY calls, to help debugging, to allow for a progress indicator 
    both at the Bucardo and Postgres levels, and to prevent crashes seen on 
    older versions of Postgres when very large IN() lists are used. [GSM]

  - When using "bucardo_ctl add all tables", ignore any tables inside 
    schemas starting with 'bucardo' [GSM]

  - Allow --verbose flag for list syncs to show linked tables [GSM]

  - Allow --verbose flag for list tables to show linked herds and syncs [GSM]

  - Change rebuild_index to a smallint: a 1 only runs it with a fullcopy.
    If you really want to use it otherwise, set it to 2 [GSM]

  - Allow the dbhost to be turned off (local socket only) in the db table 
    when using "bucardo_ctl update db <name> host=non. [GSM]

  - Allow ping to be specified for new tables added via "add sync" [GSM]


Bucardo version 4.0.2, released September 16, 2009

  - Add the name of the database to the install choices, as some systems 
    have mismatched names (BSD's 'pgsql' user) [Vilem Kebrt]

  - Clear out stale q entries on startup, created when a kid was hit with a 
    kill -9. This was causing Bucardo to think the q slot was still active. [GSM]

  - Fix cases where we were not quoting the UNLISTEN names [GSM]

  - Remove duplicate PID numbers from log [GSM]

  - Prohibit syncs from having names reserved for synctypes. [GSM]

  - Add new delete method of "truncate_cascade" for syncs [GSM]

  - Allow "foo*", "*foo", and "*foo*" wildcard format in bucardo_ctl 
    when specifying syncs, e.g. bucardo_ctl kick ABC* [GSM]

  - Allow special cases for bucardo_ctl kick: "all [synctype] [active]" [GSM]

  - Allow filtering of 'bucardo_ctl list syncs' by synctype [GSM]

  - Allow 'bucardo_ctl add sync tables=...' to work with schema.table format [GSM]

  - Add --verbose option to 'bucardo_ctl list syncs' to show tables [GSM]

New features:

  - Add support for multi-column primary keys. Thanks to Backcountry.com. [GSM]

  - Add new 'onetimecopy' attribute to sync table, to allow recreation on 
    demand of pushdelta tables on slaves via COPY. [GSM]

  - Support for replication after TRUNCATE. This will only work on 
    Postgres version 8.4 and higher, and only pushdelta syncs. [GSM]

  - Add log_conflict_details to allow logging of conflict information 
    to a separate file. [Adam Wendt]

  - Add 'maxkicks' and 'lifetime' to syncs to force restart of controller 
    and kids after a certain number of kicks or time. [Josh Tolley]
    Thanks to Backcountry.com.

  - Allow replication of sequences. [GSM]

  - Add the bucardo_custom_trigger table, which allows tight control of exactly

    an interface for same in bucardo_ctl. [GSM]

  - Add the "warning_file" config parameter to log all 'Warning' messages. [GSM]

  - Add validate_all_syncs() function, and allow an argument to both that 
    and validate_sync() to force recreation of supporting objects. [GSM]

Enhancements:

  - Remove 'Moose' dependency. [GSM]

  - Remove disable_triggers and disable_rules from the sync table. 
    We simply choose pg_class or replica based on the version of the 
    database in question. [GSM]

  - Rewrite the pushdelta sync method to be more efficient and safer. [GSM]

  - Change from Mail::Sendmail to Net::SMTP [Ben Allen]

    and automatic. [Selena Deckelmann and GSM]

  - Add more tests and improve existing ones. [Josh Tolley]

  - Force READ WRITE mode so Bucardo works on read only databases. [GSM]

  - Make the audit_pid table more useful. Use sequences instead of 
    PIDs to find children. Allow for the audit_pid table to be toggled off. [GSM]

  - Remove the debugstderr and debugstdout options, as they never worked 
    correctly anyway. [GSM]

  - When truncating during fullcopy, fallback to delete if it fails. [GSM]

  - On startup, all syncs that may have trigger-based notifies are 
    initially kicked. [GSM]

  - Have master_q use a trigger, not multiple rules. Remove the need 
    for a separate create_child_q() function. [GSM]

  - Add INSTALL_BUCARDODIR for quick and dirty 'make install' [GSM]

Bug fixes:

  - Fix failure to disable/enable triggers when using pg_class and table 
    and schema are words changed by quote_ident. [Ben Allen]
