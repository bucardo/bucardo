Postgres has a procedural language called **plpgsql** that Bucardo makes heavy use of. This language comes automatically with all installations of Postgres, but you may need to load it into the current database by running:

` CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

See the [requirements](/Bucardo/Requirements "wikilink") page for information on where the language is needed.
