Bucardo - a table-based replication system

DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is version 3.2.7 of Bucardo.

it under the same terms as Perl itself, either Perl version 5.8.3 or,
at your option, any later version of Perl 5 you may have available.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

    build, test, and install Perl 5             (at least 5.8.3)
    build, test, and install Postgres           (at least 8.1)
    build, test, and install the DBI module     (at least 1.51)
    build, test, and install the DBD::Pg module (at least 2.0.0)
    
    You must have at least one database that has Pl/Pgsql and Pl/Perl installed.
	Target databases may need Pl/Pgsql.


INSTALLATION:
-------------
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (but see below first)
   make install

EXAMPLES:
---------

See the test suite in the t/ subdirectory for some examples.


TESTING:
--------

Because Test::Harness does not play well with forking, the Makefile will attempt to 
start a small helper daemon for controlling Bucardo from within the tests. You will 
need to tell the test script where it can find some databases to test with by 
editing this file:

	t/bucardo.test.data

Once that is set, simply do the usual:

	make test

Or better still:

	make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
